# Hey do you like socket.io and whiteboards?
### yeah, but the demo they give you doesn't save anything
# WELL DO I HAVE THE DEMO FOR YOU!
## what if I told you that you could make a simple socket.io whiteboard and permanently persist the drawings?
## well gee how would I do that?
# WITH MONGODB OF COURSE!

# Setup
First, install mongoDB using the package manager of your choice. Then fire it up with the default settings.

Clone this repository, and run ```npm install``` to pull in the dependencies (express, socket.io, mongo driver).

Run ```node index.js``` to start the server on port 3000.
